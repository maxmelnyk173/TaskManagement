This implementation was designed with simplicity and clarity in mind. It uses SQLite for persistence and exposes the API via OpenAPI and Swagger UI, providing a lightweight way to explore functionality without building a dedicated frontend. The task reassignment logic runs in a background worker every two minutes, processing tasks in batches. User availability are cached in memory to reduce database queries during reassignment. While suitable for demonstration or limited-scale scenarios, scaling this design would require distributed locks, shared caching (e.g., Redis), and more efficient update and read strategies to support high load or concurrent environments.
